NEXTJS
-> It fixes waterfalling
1. From the nearby CDN, we get the index.html file which has a script tag to JS file which contains all the React code. 
2. Then all the components which doesn't depend on backend renders. 
3. Simultaneously another request goes to the BE and gets the data and other components are renedered.

-> SEO optimised
In react the initial html file that we receive file is empty and contains a link to a JS file. But search engines doesn't run JS. Therefore SE cannot scrape an empty HTML.

-> React doesn't work on places where JS cannot run
Because if JS can't execute we are left with an empty html file which is useless.
