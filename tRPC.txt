--tRPC--

RPC -> Remote Procedural Call 
-> Calling backend using function calls in the frontend
-> Another such similar famous library is gRPC by Google
-> tRPC is for TypeScript
-> Under the hood HTTP is only used, but we call the BE using function.

Why tRPC?
1. Automatic types on FE and BE
2. Generic code for different frameworks. Eg: same tRPC code works for express, NextJS, etc. Therefore we need to write code only once and takes away the pain of migrating codebase to       different frameworks
-> This is done using adapters.
-> The tRPC code is converted to the BE framework's code with the help of respective framework specific adapter.


--CONTEXTS AND MIDDLEWARES--

1. Context
-> Context holds all the data that all the tRPC procedures need to access like db and auth. 
-> Create a context. 2 steps
-> 1. Define the type of the context during trpc init
